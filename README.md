### Good next programs to implement

<details>

  <summary>Open the list</summary>
  
- [ ] wav-files-**eq**: Apply equalization filters to boost/cut specific frequency bands in WAV files. Why? Builds on spectrogram visualization for targeted audio shaping; useful for mastering or voice enhancement.
- [ ] wav-files-**compress**: Apply dynamic range compression to even out loud/soft parts in WAV files, with adjustable ratio/threshold. Why? Pairs with normalization for professional loudness control; prevents clipping in mixed or concatenated files.
- [ ] wav-files-**metadata**: Edit or extract embedded metadata (e.g., artist, title, comments) in WAV files using RIFF chunks. Why? Fills a gap in file handling; integrates with stats and validation for better organization in folders.
- [ ] wav-files-**waveform**: Generate static waveform plot images (PNG/SVG) from WAV files, with customizable styles. Why? Expands visualization beyond spectrograms; quick for previews or reports alongside stats.
- [ ] wav-files-**fft**: Compute and export Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) data as text/CSV for frequency analysis of WAV files. Why? Deeper dive beyond spectrograms for quantitative spectral insights; supports research or automated quality checks.
- [ ] wav-files-**mix**: Overlay or blend multiple WAV files into a single output, with volume balancing and channel mapping (e.g., stereo mixdown)
- [ ] wav-files-**volume**: Adjust overall gain or apply random volume scaling (e.g., Â±dB range) to WAV files for dynamic loudness variation. Why for ML? Simulates real-world recording inconsistencies (e.g., microphone distance); pairs with normalization to prevent overfitting in tasks like speaker identification, boosting generalization as seen in torchaudio pipelines.
- [ ] wav-files-**shift**: Perform time-domain shifting by inserting silence or cropping edges to offset audio start/end randomly. Why for ML? Introduces temporal misalignment common in streaming audio; essential for sequence models (e.g., RNNs/LSTMs) in event detection, reducing sensitivity to exact timing as in raw waveform augmentations.
- [ ] wav-files-**crop**: Extract fixed-length random segments (with overlap options) from longer WAV files. Why for ML? Generates variable-length clips for balanced batching in training; critical for fixed-input models like CNNs on audio spectrograms, mimicking dataset imbalances in environmental sound classification.
- [ ] wav-files-**mask**: Apply time-domain masking by zeroing out random contiguous segments (e.g., SpecAugment-inspired on waveform). Why for ML? Encourages models to focus on partial signals, enhancing robustness to occlusions; useful for bioacoustics or music tagging where partial data is common, as in masking strategies for DL.
- [ ] wav-files-**channel**: Swap, drop, or mix stereo channels (e.g., mono conversion with panning) for multi-channel WAV files. Why for ML? Handles channel imbalances in stereo datasets; augments for mono-compatible models, aiding transfer learning in spatial audio tasks like source separation.
